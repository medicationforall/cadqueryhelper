## 1.2.3

## 1.2.2
* Fixed a bug where I had changed the behavior of the hinge when I refactor.
  * the receiver and the driver were switched which had the knock effect of modifying existing projects in unexpected ways.
  * It wasn't tehnically wrong just different.
  * I added a new flag called invert which toggles the behavior of the driver and receiver.
  * Addded hinge example hinge_invert.py
  * Updated hinge documentation 

## 1.2.1
* Added additional parameters to Hinge
  * render - accepts 'driver', 'receiver', or 'both'
  * The value of render determines which parts of the hinge will be rendered.
  * Addded hinge example hinge_render.py
  * Updated hinge documentation

    * tab_height
    * tab_z_translate
* Added hinge example hinge_larger_tab.py
* Updated hinge documentation

## 1.1.2

## 1.1.1
* Refactored series to center ouput again
  * No longer relies on assembly 

## 1.1.0

## 1.0.0
* This release has "breaking" changes.
* Added type annotations.
* Removed setting meta attributes on Workplane objects (breaking change if you utilized this).
* Update documentation shape coffin image.

* renamed out directory to stl to be more in line with other project structures.
* Added Trapezoid shape.
* Added example_runner.py which runs all of the example scripts in one place
* Modified the random function is used for calculating variable height with the irregular grid. The new functions supports better type safety for floats as opposed to implicit casting to integers but the generated outputs are now different from previous versions of the library.
* Regenerated all of the examples.
